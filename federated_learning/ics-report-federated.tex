\begin{abstract}
Industrial Control Systems face unique cybersecurity challenges that traditional IT security tools cannot address.
\textbf{Federated ICS Threat Correlation Engine} introduces a unified threat detection platform that understands industrial protocols, respects process physics, predicts attack paths, validates itself continuously, and enables \textbf{privacy-preserving collaborative defense across multiple facilities}.
By integrating real-time detection, AI-powered prediction, automated forensics, adversarial testing, and federated learning, it transforms industrial security from isolated reactive monitoring to connected proactive defense.
Each facility benefits from industry-wide threat intelligence while maintaining complete data sovereignty.
\end{abstract}

\section{Problem Statement}
Industrial Control Systems operate critical infrastructure that powers modern society, yet they face unprecedented cybersecurity threats.
Legacy systems designed decades ago without security in mind now connect to networks, creating vulnerabilities that attackers actively exploit.

These weaknesses result in:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm,itemsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Limited Visibility:} Lack of monitoring in OT networks creates blind spots.
    \item \textbf{Inadequate Detection:} Traditional IT tools don't understand industrial protocols (Modbus, DNP3, OPC-UA) or process physics.
    \item \textbf{High False Positives:} Generic anomaly detection generates 20-30\% false alarms.
    \item \textbf{Isolated Learning:} Each facility learns only from its own attacks, missing industry-wide patterns.
    \item \textbf{Data Sharing Barriers:} Regulatory and competitive concerns prevent threat intelligence sharing.
    \item \textbf{Slow Threat Propagation:} Novel attacks take weeks or months to be shared across industry.
    \item \textbf{Catastrophic Impact:} Cyberattacks cause physical damage, safety incidents, and production losses.
\end{itemize}

Real-world incidents: Colonial Pipeline (2021) paid \$4.4M ransom; Ukraine power grid attacks (2015, 2016) left thousands without electricity; Triton/TRISIS (2017) targeted safety systems.

\textbf{The Critical Gap:} When one facility experiences a novel attack, others remain vulnerable until manually updated—a process taking weeks. Attackers exploit the same vulnerabilities across the industry. Traditional threat intelligence sharing is too slow and requires exposing sensitive operational data.

\section{Proposed Solution}
\textbf{Federated ICS Threat Correlation Engine} acts as both the cybersecurity brain for individual facilities and a collaborative defense network.
It continuously monitors industrial protocols, interprets process behavior, correlates threats, and coordinates responses—while enabling facilities to learn from each other without sharing sensitive data.

Five integrated capabilities:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{\arabic*.},itemsep=0pt]
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Detection} – Multi-source correlation with physics-aware anomaly detection.
    \item \textbf{AI-Powered Attack Prediction} – Graph Neural Networks predict attacker's next moves using MITRE ATT\&CK for ICS.
    \item \textbf{Automated Forensic Playback} – Time-travel investigation with evidence reconstruction in seconds.
    \item \textbf{Adversarial Resilience Testing} – Built-in red team mode with continuous validation.
    \item \textbf{Federated Learning Network} – Privacy-preserving collaborative learning across facilities.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Federated Learning: The Game Changer}

\subsection{What is Federated Learning?}
Federated Learning enables multiple parties to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging raw data.
Instead of centralizing data, the model travels to where data resides, trains locally, and only learned patterns (model weights) are shared.

\textbf{Traditional ML:} All facilities send data to central database → Train one model → Deploy everywhere. \textit{Problem: Sensitive data leaves premises.}

\textbf{Federated Learning:} Central server sends model to facilities → Each trains locally → Facilities send only weight updates → Server aggregates → Improved model distributed. \textit{Advantage: Raw data never leaves facility.}

\subsection{Why Federated Learning for ICS?}

\textbf{1. Privacy and Regulatory Requirements}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm,itemsep=0pt]
    \item Critical infrastructure data is highly sensitive (process parameters, production rates, configurations)
    \item Regulatory frameworks (NERC CIP, IEC 62443, GDPR) restrict data sharing
    \item Competitive concerns prevent sharing operational details
    \item National security implications for critical infrastructure
\end{itemize}

\textbf{2. Distributed Infrastructure}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm,itemsep=0pt]
    \item Multiple facilities with similar equipment but different configurations
    \item Geographically distributed operations
    \item Attacks often target multiple facilities with similar vulnerabilities
\end{itemize}

\textbf{3. Collaborative Defense Benefits}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1cm,itemsep=0pt]
    \item Novel attack at one facility protects all others within hours
    \item Industry-wide threat intelligence without centralized data repository
    \item Improved detection accuracy from diverse training data
    \item Reduced false positives through broader baseline learning
\end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Data Isolation:} Raw data never leaves facility. Only model weights transmitted.
    \item \textbf{Differential Privacy:} Calibrated noise added to weights. Provides (ε=2.0, δ=10⁻⁵) guarantees.
    \item \textbf{Secure Aggregation:} Server cannot see individual updates, only aggregate.
    \item \textbf{Gradient Clipping:} Limits influence of any single facility. Prevents poisoning.
    \item \textbf{Byzantine-Robust:} Detects and excludes malicious updates using statistical techniques.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Communication Security:}
TLS 1.3 encryption, mutual authentication, API key rotation, rate limiting, network isolation.
