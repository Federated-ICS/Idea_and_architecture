- **Automated Forensic Playback**: Time-travel investigation with evidence reconstruction in under 30 seconds
- **Adversarial Resilience Testing**: Built-in red team mode with continuous validation
- **Federated Learning Network**: Privacy-preserving collaborative defense across facilities with mathematical privacy guarantees (Œµ=2.0, Œ¥=10‚Åª‚Åµ)

### Performance Metrics

- Detection Latency: <30 seconds
- Detection Accuracy: >95%
- False Positive Rate: <5%
- Attack Prediction Accuracy: 67%
- MITRE ATT&CK Coverage: 87%
- Threat Propagation Time: 6-24 hours (vs weeks with traditional methods)

## Key Concepts

### Federated Learning
Enables multiple facilities to collaboratively train ML models without sharing raw data. Each facility trains locally and only shares model weight updates with privacy protection.

### Differential Privacy
Mathematical guarantee that individual data points cannot be identified from model outputs. Implemented with Œµ=2.0 and Œ¥=10‚Åª‚Åµ.

### MITRE ATT&CK for ICS
Framework of 81 techniques across 12 tactics specific to industrial control systems. Used for attack prediction and correlation.

### Physics-Aware Detection
Validates sensor readings against physical process constraints (temperature ranges, pressure limits, flow dependencies) to detect impossible or dangerous states.
