# The 5 Core Features of Federated ICS Threat Correlation Engine

Based on the project documents, here are the **5 Core Features** of the Federated ICS Threat Correlation Engine:

---

## 🎯 **The 5 Core Features**

### **1. Real-Time Detection** 🔍
**Multi-Source Threat Detection with Physics-Aware Anomaly Detection**

**What it does:**
- Monitors industrial protocols (Modbus, DNP3, OPC-UA, S7) in real-time
- Uses multiple detection methods working together:
  - **LSTM Autoencoder**: Detects behavioral anomalies in time-series data
  - **Isolation Forest**: Catches sudden outliers and point anomalies
  - **Physics Rules Engine**: Validates process constraints (temperature, pressure, flow rates)
  - **Protocol Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual protocol behavior

**Key Metrics:**
- ⚡ **<30 seconds** detection latency (event to alert)
- 🎯 **>95% accuracy** with **<5% false positives**
- 📊 **87% MITRE ATT&CK for ICS coverage**

**Why it matters:**
Traditional IT security tools don't understand industrial protocols or process physics. This feature provides ICS-specific detection that understands both the cyber and physical aspects of attacks.

### **2. AI-Powered Attack Prediction** 🔮
**Graph Neural Networks Predict Attacker's Next Move**

**What it does:**
- Uses Graph Attention Network (GAT) with MITRE ATT&CK for ICS
- Analyzes current attack state and predicts next likely techniques
- Provides probability distribution over possible next steps
- Identifies target assets and timeframes

**Example:**
```
Detected: T0846 (Remote System Discovery)
Predicts: T0843 (Program Download) - 67% probability
Target: PLC-REACTOR-01
Timeframe: 15-60 minutes
```

**Key Metrics:**
- 🔮 **67% accuracy** for next-step prediction
- ⏱️ **15-60 minute** warning before next attack step
- 🎯 Specific asset targeting

**Why it matters:**
Instead of just reacting to attacks, you can **proactively defend** by preparing for the attacker's next move before it happens. This shifts security from reactive to proactive.

---

### **3. Automated Forensic Playback** 🕵️
**Time-Travel Investigation with Evidence Reconstruction**

**What it does:**
- Always-on capture of protocol messages, sensor readings, and metadata
- Selective deep capture (full packets) triggered by suspicious activity
- Reconstructs complete attack timelines in seconds
- Provides evidence for investigation and compliance

**Capabilities:**
- Query: "Show me all activity on PLC-REACTOR-01 from 2 hours before alert"
- Result: Complete timeline with every command, connection, and change
- Time to reconstruct: **<30 seconds** (vs hours/days manually)

**Key Metrics:**
- ⚡ **<30 seconds** timeline reconstruction
- 📉 **80% reduction** in investigation time
- 🔒 All data stays **local** (privacy/compliance)

**Why it matters:**
When an incident occurs, you need to understand exactly what happened, how the attacker got in, and what they did. This feature turns hours of manual log analysis into seconds of automated reconstruction.

### **4. Adversarial Resilience Testing** 🛡️
**Built-in Red Team Mode with Continuous Validation**

**What it does:**
- Mirrors production traffic in a safe test environment
- Injects 15+ attack scenarios covering MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Continuously validates detection capabilities
- Measures coverage and identifies gaps
- Tests federated learning improvements

**Attack Scenarios Include:**
- Modbus function code manipulation
- PLC program download attacks
- DNP3 command injection
- Unauthorized parameter changes
- Man-in-the-middle attacks

**Key Metrics:**
- 🎯 **87% MITRE ATT&CK for ICS coverage**
- 🔄 **Continuous validation** (not one-time pen test)
- ✅ **15+ attack scenarios**

**Why it matters:**
You can't trust a security system that doesn't test itself. This feature ensures your defenses actually work and continuously validates improvements from federated learning.

### **5. Federated Learning Network** 🌐 ⭐
**Privacy-Preserving Collaborative Defense Across Facilities**

**What it does:**
- Enables multiple facilities to learn from each other's attacks **without sharing sensitive data**
- Runs 4 federated learning rounds per day (every 6 hours)
- When one facility is attacked, all others gain protection within 6-24 hours
- Uses multi-layer privacy protection:
  - **Differential Privacy** (ε=2.0, δ=10⁻⁵)
  - **Secure Aggregation** (server can't see individual updates)
  - **Gradient Clipping** (limits update magnitude)
  - **Byzantine-Robust** (excludes malicious participants)

**How it works:**
```
1. FL Server sends model to all facilities
2. Each facility trains locally on their data (5 epochs)
3. Facilities send only weight updates (~10 MB) with privacy protection
4. Server aggregates updates (can't see individual contributions)
5. Improved model distributed to all facilities
```

**Key Metrics:**
- ⚡ **6-24 hours** threat propagation (vs weeks/months traditional)
- 🔒 **Mathematical privacy guarantees** (ε=2.0, δ=10⁻⁵)
- 🚀 **4 rounds per day** (every 6 hours)
- 📈 **Accuracy improves** with more facilities (96% with 10 facilities, 97% with 50)
- 📦 **Only 10 MB** transmitted per facility per round

**Why it matters:**
This is the **game-changer**. Traditional threat intelligence sharing takes weeks and requires exposing sensitive data. Federated learning enables **real-time collaborative defense** while maintaining **complete data sovereignty**. When one facility experiences a novel attack, all others are protected within hours, not weeks.

## 🌟 **How They Work Together**

These 5 features form an integrated defense system:

```
1. Real-Time Detection → Identifies threats as they happen
2. Attack Prediction → Anticipates next moves
3. Forensic Playback → Investigates what happened
4. Red Team Testing → Validates everything works
5. Federated Learning → Shares intelligence across facilities

Result: Proactive, collaborative, self-improving defense
```

## 💡 **The Unique Value Proposition**

### **Traditional ICS Security:**
- Isolated (each facility learns alone)
- Reactive (responds after attack)
- Slow intelligence sharing (weeks/months)
- Data exposure concerns

### **Federated ICS Engine:**
- Collaborative (industry-wide learning)
- Proactive (predicts next moves)
- Fast intelligence sharing (6-24 hours)
- Privacy-preserving (mathematical guarantees)

**Bottom Line:** Transforms ICS security from **isolated reactive monitoring** to **connected proactive defense** with **privacy by design**.
