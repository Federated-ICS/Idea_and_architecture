# What MUST Be in the Demo

## Overview

This document defines the absolute essential features that must be demonstrated by November 30, 2025 to prove the unique value proposition of the Federated ICS Threat Correlation Engine.

---

## MUST HAVE - Core Demo Requirements

### 1. Federated Learning (THE KILLER FEATURE) üèÜ

**Why it's critical:** This is your ONLY unique differentiator vs competitors

**Must demonstrate:**
- ‚úÖ 3 simulated facilities (Facility A, B, C)
- ‚úÖ FL Server coordinating rounds
- ‚úÖ Visual proof that:
  - Facility A gets attacked
  - FL round triggered
  - Model updated and distributed
  - Facilities B & C now detect the same attack
- ‚úÖ Show timing: "6-24 hours" vs "weeks/months" for traditional sharing

**Demo scenario:**
```
1. Show Facility A detecting novel attack
2. Trigger FL round (show it happening)
3. Show Facilities B & C receiving updated model
4. Replay same attack on Facility B ‚Üí Now detected!
5. Show dashboard: "All facilities protected in 6 hours"
```

**Why essential:** Without this, you're just another ICS security tool.

---

### 2. Real-Time Detection (PROOF IT WORKS) ‚úÖ

**Why it's critical:** Need to show the system actually detects threats with multiple methods

**Must demonstrate:**
- ‚úÖ THREE working detection methods running in parallel:
  - **LSTM Autoencoder** - Behavioral anomalies (temporal patterns)
  - **Isolation Forest** - Point anomalies (sudden outliers)
  - **Physics Rules Engine** - Process violations (safety constraints)
- ‚úÖ Real-time alerts appearing on dashboard (<30 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Clear visualization of anomaly detection
- ‚úÖ Correlation showing multiple sources agree

**Why all three methods:**
- **LSTM:** Detects subtle behavioral changes over time
- **Isolation Forest:** Catches sudden spikes and outliers LSTM might miss
- **Physics Rules:** Validates against known safety constraints
- **Together:** Reduces false positives, increases confidence

**Demo scenario:**
```
1. Show normal operation (green, all good)
2. Inject Modbus attack with sudden value spike
3. Isolation Forest detects outlier immediately (<5 seconds)
4. LSTM detects behavioral anomaly (within 30 seconds)
5. Physics rules violated (temperature out of range)
6. Correlation engine: "Detected by all 3 sources - CRITICAL"
7. Alert appears on dashboard with high confidence (0.95)
```

**Why essential:** 
- Proves robust multi-layered detection
- Shows defense-in-depth approach
- Demonstrates low false positive rate (all 3 agree = real threat)

---

### 3. Dashboard Visualization (SHOW, DON'T TELL) üìä

**Why it's critical:** Visual proof is more convincing than logs

**Must have pages:**
- ‚úÖ **Alerts Dashboard** - Real-time alert feed
- ‚úÖ **FL Status Page** - Show rounds, clients, model updates
- ‚úÖ **System Overview** - 3 facilities, their status

**Minimum viable:**
- Simple, clean interface (doesn't need to be fancy)
- Real-time updates (WebSocket)
- Clear status indicators (green/red)

**Demo scenario:**
```
1. Show dashboard with 3 facilities
2. Facility A: Alert appears (red)
3. FL Status: Round in progress
4. Facilities B & C: Models updating
5. All facilities: Now protected (green)
```

**Why essential:** Makes the abstract concept concrete and visible.

---

### 4. Privacy Preservation (TRUST FACTOR) üîí

**Why it's critical:** Addresses the "why not just share data?" question

**Must demonstrate:**
- ‚úÖ Show that raw data stays local
- ‚úÖ Only model weights transmitted (~10 MB)
- ‚úÖ Differential privacy applied (Œµ=2.0, Œ¥=10‚Åª‚Åµ)

**Demo scenario:**
```
1. Show Facility A's sensitive data (temperature, pressure)
2. Show FL round: "Transmitting weights only (10 MB)"
3. Show privacy metrics: "Œµ=2.0 guarantee"
4. Emphasize: "Raw data never left Facility A"
```

**Why essential:** This is what makes FL acceptable for critical infrastructure.

---

### 5. Attack Prediction (WOW FACTOR) üîÆ

**Why it's critical:** Proactive defense - predicts attacker's next move

**Must demonstrate:**
- ‚úÖ Graph Neural Network (GAT) predicting next attack steps
- ‚úÖ MITRE ATT&CK for ICS technique mapping
- ‚úÖ Probability scores for next likely techniques
- ‚úÖ Visual graph showing attack progression

**Demo scenario:**
```
1. Show current attack: T0846 (Remote System Discovery)
2. GNN predicts next steps:
   - T0843 (Program Download) - 67% probability
   - T0800 (Lateral Movement) - 23% probability
   - T0858 (Change Operating Mode) - 10% probability
3. Show target asset: PLC-REACTOR-01
4. Show timeframe: "15-60 minutes"
5. Attacker proceeds with T0843 ‚Üí System predicted it!
6. Show proactive defense: "Blocked based on prediction"
```

**Why essential:** Shifts from reactive to proactive defense - unique competitive advantage.

**Federated Learning Enhancement:**
- GNN learns attack patterns from all facilities
- When Facility A sees new attack chain, all facilities learn it
- Improves prediction accuracy across the network

---

## NICE TO HAVE - Enhances Demo

---

### 6. Protocol Anomaly Detection

**Why it's nice:** Additional layer but not essential with 3 methods already

**If you have time:**
- Deep packet inspection for protocol violations
- Malformed message detection
- Unusual command sequences

**Skip for MVP:** Focus on LSTM, Isolation Forest, and Physics Rules first

---

### 7. Multiple Protocols

**Why it's nice:** Shows versatility but not essential

**Minimum:** Modbus only

**Nice to have:** + DNP3

**Skip for MVP:** OPC-UA, S7

---

## CAN SKIP - Not Essential for Demo

### 8. Advanced Forensics ‚ùå
- Time-travel investigation nice but not essential
- Can be basic query interface for MVP

### 9. Red Team Simulator ‚ùå
- Automated testing not essential
- Manual attack injection sufficient

### 10. MongoDB ‚ùå
- Can use PostgreSQL for logs
- Reduces complexity (but keep if time allows)

### 11. Multiple Protocols Beyond Modbus ‚ùå
- DNP3, OPC-UA, S7 can wait
- Modbus sufficient for demo

---

## Absolute Minimum Demo (If Time is Tight)

### The 3-Minute Demo

**Script:**

**1. SHOW: 3 facilities running, all green**
- "Three power plants, each with their own ICS"

**2. ATTACK: Facility A gets hit**
- "Novel Modbus attack on Facility A"
- ‚Üí Alert appears, LSTM detects anomaly

**3. FEDERATED LEARNING: Round triggered**
- "FL round initiated - facilities learning together"
- ‚Üí Show FL status: training, aggregating, distributing

**4. PROTECTION: Facilities B & C now protected**
- "6 hours later, all facilities protected"
- ‚Üí Replay attack on Facility B ‚Üí Immediately detected!

**5. PRIVACY: Emphasize data sovereignty**
- "Facility A's data never left their premises"
- ‚Üí Show: Only 10 MB weights transmitted

**6. COMPARISON: Traditional vs Federated**
- "Traditional: Weeks to share threat intelligence"
- "Federated: 6 hours, automatic, privacy-preserving"

**This proves:**
- ‚úÖ Detection works
- ‚úÖ FL works
- ‚úÖ Privacy preserved
- ‚úÖ Faster than competitors
- ‚úÖ Collaborative defense

## Risk Mitigation

### If Federated Learning is Delayed
**Fallback:** Show simulated FL with manual model updates
**Impact:** Still demonstrates concept, less impressive

### If One Detection Method Fails
**Fallback:** Demonstrate with 2 out of 3 methods (any combination works)
**Impact:** Still shows multi-layered approach, slightly less impressive
**Note:** Having all 3 working is ideal but not critical - 2 methods sufficient

### If Dashboard is Behind
**Fallback:** Use command-line demo with logs
**Impact:** Less visual but proves functionality

### If Integration Fails
**Fallback:** Demonstrate components separately
**Impact:** Less impressive but shows individual capabilities
